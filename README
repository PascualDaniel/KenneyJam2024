# A game made for the 2024 KenneyJam.
It is a prototype of a puzzle game where you have to send a package from an input to an output by placing different components.
Currently there is only the frame of the construction and a few small mechanics.
It can be played here: [demo](https://paxcu.itch.io/coveyor-belt-demo)
